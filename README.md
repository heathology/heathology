# When I am not developing/programming
- :tv: I love watching the following: absolutely anything in the MCU, Family Guy, M*A*S*H, NCIS, Bosch/Bosch:Legacy
- 👀 I’m interested in theology and history. I am actually a historical theologian. I enjoy learning new things (thus my foray into programming and web development).
- 🌱 I have been completing Harvard's CS50 course which includes studying C, Python, SQL, and Javascript. I am also completing <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://scrimba.com/">Scrimba</a> certifications. Finally, I have been learning a lot thanks to the community at <a href="https://www.techlahoma.org/">Techlahoma</a>.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects.
